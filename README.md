# RogueLike2023
I am following the RLTK tutorial listed on the r/RoguelikeDev side bar. 
I have already followed the tutorial once before but this will help things sink in a little more. I plan on introducing my own features along the way as well.
##I do want to point out that I am using RLTK because it employs a data driven Entity-Component System design. It uses the Specs library: https://github.com/amethyst/specs. If you are interested in ECS designs then I recommend that you give this tutorial a try.  

Part 0 - Setting Up

Get your development environment and editor setup and working.

Part 1 - Drawing the ‘@’ symbol and moving it around

The next step is drawing an @ and using the keyboard to move it.
